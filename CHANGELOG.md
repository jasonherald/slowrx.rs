# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added (PR-1)
- VIS header detection via `Goertzel` filter + parity check (`src/vis.rs`).
- `SstvDecoder` now emits `SstvEvent::VisDetected` when a clean PD120 or
  PD180 VIS burst is recognized in the audio stream.
- 92% per-file coverage gate via `cargo-llvm-cov`.
- Property tests against arbitrary audio inputs.

### Added (PR-0)
- Public API skeleton: `SstvDecoder`, `SstvEvent`, `SstvImage`, `SstvMode`,
  `ModeSpec`, `Error`, `Result`, `Resampler`.
- Mode specifications for PD120 and PD180 (timing constants translated
  from slowrx's `modespec.c`).
- Crate-level rustdoc with a runnable `## Example` snippet.
- MIT-licensed crate with ISC notice preservation for slowrx attribution.

### Fixed (PR-0 CR round 1)
- `SstvImage::pixel` and `SstvImage::put_pixel` now degrade gracefully
  (return `None` / no-op) when caller-mutated metadata desyncs from the
  pixel buffer length. Previously could panic from safe code paths.
- `modespec.rs` module rustdoc clarified — V2 modes are planned, not
  "listed in the enum."
